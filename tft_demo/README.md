# TFT Demo for Wemos S3 Mini Pro v1.1.0

This uses the [moononournation/GFX Library for Arduino](https://github.com/moononournation/Arduino_GFX). The one often used in examples I found used the Adafruit library, however I found that the colors were always wrong. This library works perfectly and has the colors correct and is very similar (same?) to use.
